   /**
    *  @brief base for all database objects
    *
    *  The object is the fundamental building block of the database and
    *  is the level upon which undo/redo operations are performed.  Objects
    *  are used to track data and their relationships and provide an effecient
    *  means to find and update information.
    *
    *  Objects are assigned a unique and sequential object ID by the database within
    *  the id_space defined in the object.
    *
    *  All objects must be serializable via FC_REFLECT() and their content must be
    *  faithfully restored.   Additionally all objects must be copy-constructable and
    *  assignable in a relatively efficient manner.  In general this means that objects
    *  should only refer to other objects by ID and avoid expensive operations when
    *  they are copied, especially if they are modified frequently.
    *
    *  Additionally all objects may be annotated by plugins which wish to maintain
    *  additional information to an object.  There can be at most one annotation
    *  per id_space for each object.   An example of an annotation would be tracking
    *  extra data not required by validation such as the name and description of
    *  a user asset.  By carefully organizing how information is organized and
    *  tracked systems can minimize the workload to only that which is necessary
    *  to perform their function.
    *
    *  @note Do not use multiple inheritance with object because the code assumes
    *  a static_cast will work between object and derived types.
