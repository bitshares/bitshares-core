 * However, accounts which have a special_authority are very rare.  So rather
 * than indexing account_object by the special_authority fields (requiring additional
 * bookkeeping for every account), we instead maintain a special_authority_object
 * pointing to each account which has special_authority (requiring additional
 * bookkeeping only for every account which has special_authority).
 *
 * This class is an implementation detail.
