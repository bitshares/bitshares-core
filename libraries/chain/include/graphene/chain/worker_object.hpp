/**
  * @defgroup worker_types Implementations of the various worker types in the system
  *
  * The system has various worker types, which do different things with the money they are paid. These worker types
  * and their semantics are specified here.
  *
  * All worker types exist as a struct containing the data this worker needs to evaluate, as well as a method
  * pay_worker, which takes a pay amount and a non-const database reference, and applies the worker's specific pay
  * semantics to the worker_type struct and/or the database. Furthermore, all worker types have an initializer,
  * which is a struct containing the data needed to create that kind of worker.
  *
  * Each initializer type has a method, init, which takes a non-const database reference, a const reference to the
  * worker object being created, and a non-const reference to the specific *_worker_type object to initialize. The
  * init method creates any further objects, and initializes the worker_type object as necessary according to the
  * semantics of that particular worker type.
  *
  * To create a new worker type, define a my_new_worker_type struct with a pay_worker method which updates the
  * my_new_worker_type object and/or the database. Create a my_new_worker_type::initializer struct with an init
  * method and any data members necessary to create a new worker of this type. Reflect my_new_worker_type and
  * my_new_worker_type::initializer into FC's type system, and add them to @ref worker_type and @ref
  * worker_initializer respectively. Make sure the order of types in @ref worker_type and @ref worker_initializer
  * remains the same.
