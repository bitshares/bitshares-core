 * buyback_authority_object only exists to help with a specific indexing problem.
 * We want to be able to iterate over all assets that have a buyback program.
 * However, assets which have a buyback program are very rare.  So rather
 * than indexing asset_object by the buyback field (requiring additional
 * bookkeeping for every asset), we instead maintain a buyback_object
 * pointing to each asset which has buyback (requiring additional
 * bookkeeping only for every asset which has buyback).
 *
 * This class is an implementation detail.
