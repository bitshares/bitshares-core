    *  of cashback and worker operations.  This operation allows
    *  vesting balances to be created manually as well.
    *
    *  Manual creation of vesting balances can be used by a stakeholder
    *  to publicly demonstrate that they are committed to the chain.
    *  It can also be used as a building block to create transactions
    *  that function like public debt.  Finally, it is useful for
    *  testing vesting balance functionality.
