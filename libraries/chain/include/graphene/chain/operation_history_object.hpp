    *  not part of "core validation".   Account history is maintained as
    *  a linked list stored on disk in a stack.  Each account will point to the
    *  most recent account history object by ID.  When a new operation relativent
    *  to that account is processed a new account history object is allcoated at
    *  the end of the stack and intialized to point to the prior object.
    *
    *  This data is never accessed as part of chain validation and therefore
    *  can be kept on disk as a memory mapped file.  Using a memory mapped file
    *  will help the operating system better manage / cache / page files and
    *  also accelerates load time.
    *
    *  When the transaction history for a particular account is requested the
    *  linked list can be traversed with relatively effecient disk access because
    *  of the use of a memory mapped stack.
