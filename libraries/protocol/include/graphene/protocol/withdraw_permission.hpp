    * @brief Create a new withdrawal permission
    * @ingroup operations
    *
    * This operation creates a withdrawal permission, which allows some authorized account to withdraw from an
    * authorizing account. This operation is primarily useful for scheduling recurring payments.
    *
    * Withdrawal permissions define withdrawal periods, which is a span of time during which the authorized account may
    * make a withdrawal. Any number of withdrawals may be made so long as the total amount withdrawn per period does
    * not exceed the limit for any given period.
    *
    * Withdrawal permissions authorize only a specific pairing, i.e. a permission only authorizes one specified
    * authorized account to withdraw from one specified authorizing account. Withdrawals are limited and may not exceet
    * the withdrawal limit. The withdrawal must be made in the same asset as the limit; attempts with withdraw any
    * other asset type will be rejected.
    *
    * The fee for this operation is paid by withdraw_from_account, and this account is required to authorize this
    * operation.
