   /**
    * @defgroup workers The Blockchain Worker System
    * @ingroup operations
    *
    * BitShares blockchains allow the creation of special "workers" which are elected positions paid by the blockchain
    * for services they provide. There may be several types of workers, and the semantics of how and when they are paid
    * are defined by the @ref graphene::chain::worker_type enumeration.
    * All workers are elected by core stakeholder approval, by
    * voting for or against them.
    *
    * Workers are paid from the blockchain's daily budget if their total approval (votes for - votes against) is
    * positive, ordered from most positive approval to least, until the budget is exhausted. Payments are processed at
    * the blockchain maintenance interval. If a worker does not have positive approval during payment processing, or if
    * the chain's budget is exhausted before the worker is paid, that worker is simply not paid at that interval.
    * Payment is not prorated based on percentage of the interval the worker was approved. If the chain attempts to pay
    * a worker, but the budget is insufficient to cover its entire pay, the worker is paid the remaining budget funds,
    * even though this does not fulfill his total pay. The worker will not receive extra pay to make up the difference
    * later. Worker pay is placed in a vesting balance and vests over the number of days specified at the worker's
    * creation.
    *
    * Once created, a worker is immutable and will be kept by the blockchain forever.
    *
