     * @defgroup proposed_transactions  The BitShares Transaction Proposal Protocol
     * @ingroup operations
     *
     * BitShares allows users to propose a transaction which requires approval of multiple accounts in order to execute.
     * The user proposes a transaction using proposal_create_operation, then signatory accounts use
     * proposal_update_operations to add or remove their approvals from this operation. When a sufficient number of
     * approvals have been granted, the operations in the proposal are used to create a virtual transaction which is
     * subsequently evaluated. Even if the transaction fails, the proposal will be kept until the expiration time, at
     * which point, if sufficient approval is granted, the transaction will be evaluated a final time. This allows
     * transactions which will not execute successfully until a given time to still be executed through the proposal
     * mechanism. The first time the proposed transaction succeeds, the proposal will be regarded as resolved, and all
     * future updates will be invalid.
     *
     * The proposal system allows for arbitrarily complex or recursively nested authorities. If a recursive authority
     * (i.e. an authority which requires approval of 'nested' authorities on other accounts) is required for a
     * proposal, then a second proposal can be used to grant the nested authority's approval. That is, a second
     * proposal can be created which, when sufficiently approved, adds the approval of a nested authority to the first
     * proposal. This multiple-proposal scheme can be used to acquire approval for an arbitrarily deep authority tree.
     *
     * Note that at any time, a proposal can be approved in a single transaction if sufficient signatures are available
     * on the proposal_update_operation, as long as the authority tree to approve the proposal does not exceed the
     * maximum recursion depth. In practice, however, it is easier to use proposals to acquire all approvals, as this
     * leverages on-chain notification of all relevant parties that their approval is required. Off-chain
     * multi-signature approval requires some off-chain mechanism for acquiring several signatures on a single
     * transaction. This off-chain synchronization can be avoided using proposals.
