    * The assets within a price are labeled base and quote. Throughout the BitShares code base, the convention used is
    * that the base asset is the asset being sold, and the quote asset is the asset being purchased, where the price is
    * represented as base/quote, so in the example price above the seller is looking to sell CORE asset and get USD in

       * overall.  The price at which the call is offered, in comparison to the settlement price, is

       * offer slightly less collateral per debt if Margin Call Fee Ratio (MCFR) is set, because
       * the call order must reserve some collateral to pay the fee.  We must still retain the
       * concept of MSSP, as it communicates the minimum collateralization before black swan may be
       * triggered, but we add this new method to calculate MCOP.
       *
       * Note that when we calculate the MCOP, we enact a price floor to ensure the margin call never
       * offers LESS collateral than the DEBT is worth. As such, it's important to calculate the
       * realized fee, when trading at the offer price, as a delta between total relinquished collateral
       * (DEBT*MSSP) and collateral sold to the buyer (DEBT*MCOP).  If you instead try to calculate the
       * fee by direct multiplication of MCFR, you will get the wrong answer if the price was
       * floored. (Fee is truncated when price is floored.)
