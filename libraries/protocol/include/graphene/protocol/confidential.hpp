/**
 * @defgroup stealth Stealth Transfer
 * @brief Operations related to stealth transfer of value
 *
 * Stealth Transfers enable users to maintain their finanical privacy against even
 * though all transactions are public.  Every account has three balances:
 *
 * 1. Public Balance - everyone can see the balance changes and the parties involved
 * 2. Blinded Balance - everyone can see who is transacting but not the amounts involved
 * 3. Stealth Balance - both the amounts and parties involved are obscured
 *
 * Account owners may set a flag that allows their account to receive(or not) transfers of these kinds
 * Asset issuers can enable or disable the use of each of these types of accounts.
 *
 * Using the "temp account" which has no permissions required, users can transfer a
 * stealth balance to the temp account and then use the temp account to register a new
 * account.  In this way users can use stealth funds to create anonymous accounts with which
 * they can perform other actions that are not compatible with blinded balances (such as market orders)
 *
 * @section referral_program Referral Progam
 *
 * Stealth transfers that do not specify any account id cannot pay referral fees so 100% of the
 * transaction fee is paid to the network.
 *
 * @section transaction_fees Fees
 *
 * Stealth transfers can have an arbitrarylly large size and therefore the transaction fee for
 * stealth transfers is based purley on the data size of the transaction.

/**
 *  @ingroup stealth
 *  @brief Transfers from blind to blind
 *
 *  There are two ways to transfer value while maintaining privacy:
 *  1. account to account with amount kept secret
 *  2. stealth transfers with amount sender/receiver kept secret
 *
 *  When doing account to account transfers, everyone with access to the
 *  memo key can see the amounts, but they will not have access to the funds.
 *
 *  When using stealth transfers the same key is used for control and reading
 *  the memo.
 *
 *  This operation is more expensive than a normal transfer and has
 *  a fee proportional to the size of the operation.
 *
 *  All assets in a blind transfer must be of the same type: fee.asset_id
 *  The fee_payer is the temp account and can be funded from the blinded values.
 *
 *  Using this operation you can transfer from an account and/or blinded balances
 *  to an account and/or blinded balances.
 *
 *  Stealth Transfers:
 *
 *  Assuming Receiver has key pair R,r and has shared public key R with Sender
 *  Assuming Sender has key pair S,s
 *  Generate one time key pair  O,o  as s.child(nonce) where nonce can be inferred from transaction
 *  Calculate secret V = o*R
 *  blinding_factor = sha256(V)
 *  memo is encrypted via aes of V
 *  owner = R.child(sha256(blinding_factor))
 *
 *  Sender gives Receiver output ID to complete the payment.
 *
 *  This process can also be used to send money to a cold wallet without having to
 *  pre-register any accounts.
 *
 *  Outputs are assigned the same IDs as the inputs until no more input IDs are available,
 *  in which case a the return value will be the *first* ID allocated for an output.  Additional
 *  output IDs are allocated sequentially thereafter.   If there are fewer outputs than inputs
 *  then the input IDs are freed and never used again.
