/**
 * @brief An ID for some votable object
 *
 * This class stores an ID for a votable object. The ID is comprised of two fields: a type, and an instance. The
 * type field stores which kind of object is being voted on, and the instance stores which specific object of that
 * type is being referenced by this ID.
 *
 * A value of vote_id_type is implicitly convertible to an unsigned 32-bit integer containing only the instance. It
 * may also be implicitly assigned from a uint32_t, which will update the instance. It may not, however, be
 * implicitly constructed from a uint32_t, as in this case, the type would be unknown.
 *
 * On the wire, a vote_id_type is represented as a 32-bit integer with the type in the lower 8 bits and the instance
 * in the upper 24 bits. This means that types may never exceed 8 bits, and instances may never exceed 24 bits.
 *
 * In JSON, a vote_id_type is represented as a string "type:instance", i.e. "1:5" would be type 1 and instance 5.
 *
 * @note In the BitShares protocol, vote_id_type instances are unique across types; that is to say, if an object of
 * type 1 has instance 4, an object of type 0 may not also have instance 4. In other words, the type is not a
 * namespace for instances; it is only an informational field.
